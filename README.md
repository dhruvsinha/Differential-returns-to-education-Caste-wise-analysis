# Differential-returns-to-education-Caste-wise-analysis

In this paper, I estimate the marginal return, in the
form of wages, member of every caste receives with increasing
amounts of education. I conclude that, Ceterus Paribus, postgraduates from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
community, on an average, have a lower hourly wage than postgraduates from
the forward Caste. Use IHDS II Individual level dataset to run the attached do files.
